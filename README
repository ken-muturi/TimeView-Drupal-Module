TimeView is a Drupal 7.x module developed in 2011 by Martin Norling of the 
International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) in Nairobi Kenya. 

The module plots data on a timeline using the Simile Timeline Widget. The 
current implementation depends on the LabCollector module which extracts data 
from databases at ILRI and plots them on the timeline. As a stand-alone module 
the use is limited but it can easily be used as a base for other projects or 
by using the manual input form to add data to the timeline.

DEPENDENCIES:

and without them this tool wouldn't have been possible.
